# Prodigy-Task1
Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Starting with GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI, this project demonstrates how to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.
